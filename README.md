## Getting started

If you are researching chemical contaminant biotransformations and you wish to communicate your results in a FAIR, machine-readable, and standardized format, please submit a filled-out version of BART in the supporting information of your submitted manuscript.

The template contains a description tab, and four types of tabs for entering data.
